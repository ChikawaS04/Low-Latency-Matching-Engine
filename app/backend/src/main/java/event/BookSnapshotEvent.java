/**
 * Mutable, reused carrier for a bounded top-N order book depth snapshot (SRS §3.5 depth
 * feed). Framework-free — no com.lmax, no io.netty. The engine writes into a pre-allocated
 * slot on its own thread (MatchingEngine.snapshotInto); a snapshot Disruptor (P4-2) carries
 * it to the WebSocket publisher and market data service.
 *
 * <p><b>Slot-reuse contract.</b> Only indices {@code [0, bidLevelCount)} and
 * {@code [0, askLevelCount)} are valid after a fill. Entries beyond the level count are
 * stale from a previous snapshot and MUST NOT be read. The counts — not the array
 * contents — are authoritative. This is what keeps the carrier zero-allocation across reuse:
 * snapshotInto never has to clear the array tails.
 *
 * <p>Prices are long cents (SRS §4). Empty sides carry the {@code -1L} sentinel in
 * {@code bestBid}/{@code bestAsk} and a level count of 0.

     * <p>P9-1 raised this from 10 to 20. The 10-level prefix (P4-6) capped the wire below the
     * depth the UI can show: the ladder's Depth selector offers up to 14 levels per side, so a
     * ≤10 prefix made 14 (and even 10, on a deeper book) unreachable, and left the themed
     * depth-pane scrollbar with nothing to scroll. The value stays a fixed bound so the carrier
     * remains zero-allocation across reuse (fixed-size arrays, no per-snapshot growth); it must
     * stay strictly greater than the largest Depth option (14) for the scrolling viewport to
     * engage. 20 longs × 4 arrays is ~640 B, negligible at demo volume.
