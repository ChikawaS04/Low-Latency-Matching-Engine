/**
 * Presentational depth ladder (SRS §3.7 depth chart), refined in P7-4, made a
 * scrolling viewport in P9-2.
 *
 * Pure edge: it renders only from the authoritative BOOK slice plus one derived
 * scalar (the last trade price, for the divider). It owns no socket or hook and
 * never reads EXEC or anything derived from EXEC ordering (the load-bearing
 * Phase-4 constraint). The one piece of local state is the depth selector, which
 * now sizes each pane's scrolling viewport rather than slicing the book (P9-2);
 * the full book already in hand is always rendered, and a deeper side scrolls.
 *
 * Layout, top to bottom: a depth selector, a Price / Size / Total caption, the
 * ask side (highest price on top, best ask nearest the mid divider), a spread /
 * mid / last strip, then the bid side (best bid on top, nearest the divider).
 * Each row has three columns plus a CSS depth bar whose width is proportional to
 * CUMULATIVE quantity outward from the touch.
 *
 * Bar scaling: SHARED max across both sides of the FULL book (P9-2; was the
 * visible window in P7-4). Now that every level renders, a level's bar is stable
 * as you scroll and the deepest level saturates at 100%; this is also the scale
 * the DepthCurve already uses, so the two panels agree with no separate curve
 * change. buildLadder exposes the raw 0..1 shadeFraction and a 0..100 widthPct
 * derived from it; the component sizes the bar from widthPct.
 *
 * Cents in, dollars only at this render edge via format.ts. No float price math.
 * midpointLabel is imported from format.ts so this divider and the P7-3 header
 * share one half-cent-safe definition. cumulate moved to depth.ts in P7-5 so the
 * ladder and the depth curve share one cumulation. Sentinels never surface: rows
 * are always real levels (BOOK is a server-trimmed top-N prefix, 20 per side since
 * P9-1, replaced wholesale), and spread, mid, and last are each guarded before
 * formatting.
